## 🧠 About Me

I am an enthusiastic AI & Data Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. My work spans across building intelligent systems such as UAV-based object detection using YOLOv8, interactive web applications, and data-driven projects. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems using data, and I thrive in collaborative environments that challenge my analytical and creative thinking skills.

I enjoy working on projects that combine AI/ML with user-centric design. I’ve contributed to both backend development and real-time system testing. My curiosity drives me to explore new technologies and improve my skills continuously.
